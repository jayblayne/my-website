    My name is Jeremy Johns. I am from the Ak-Chin Indian Community (Tohono 'O'odham/'Akimel 'O'odham) and an assistant professor of Linguistics at the University of Arizona. My research examines the phonology and semantics of reduplicative morphology in O'odham, a Uto-Aztecan language native to the Sonoran desert currently undergoing revitalization efforts, and explores how academic linguistics intersects with speaker communities. As a heritage speaker, I approach linguistic research from both community and academic perspectives, which has shaped my involvement in various revitalization projects including developing Arizona state-recognized language certification exams for O'odham teachers and coordinating a documentation initiative with community language teachers and elder speakers that resulted in a community dictionary. Since 2017, I have been teaching virtual O'odham language courses at Tohono O'odham Community College in Sells, AZ, from elementary through advanced levels, which has deepened my interest in language documentation and its role in supporting revitalization and maintenance efforts.
