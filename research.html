    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p>
I specialize in phonology, semantics, and language revitalization, with my current dissertation examining reduplicative 
morphology in O'odham. Using a corpus of reduplicative forms, I analyze their phonological and semantic properties, 
arguing that these forms can be reliably derived through infixation rather than ambiguous affixation processes. 
My work introduces the "Reduplicative Pathway," which demonstrates how phonological form is reshaped through constraint 
re-application driven by semantic derivation, while semantic output depends on the base form's syntactic category. 
I frame this analysis within "Community Linguistics," a framework that positions linguistic research at the intersection 
of speech communities and academic linguistics, where endangered language pedagogy informs theoretical research in a 
mutually beneficial, bidirectional relationship.
</p>
<p>
My research extends into substantial community-based work, including supervising a two-year language documentation project 
that produced a 2,000-word dictionary and 130-lesson heritage learner curriculum, designing my community's first O'odham language 
teacher certification exam for Arizona state certification, and developing transferable virtual language courses from 
elementary through advanced levels for Tohono O'odham Community College. Future research directions include experimental studies of heritage 
learner acquisition patterns to assess pedagogical efficacy and predict language change in revitalization contexts. 
This work offers both theoretical insights—particularly regarding infixation strategies and the phonology-semantics 
interface in reduplication—and a collaborative research model that addresses linguistics' extractive history while 
serving the pedagogical needs of endangered language communities.
